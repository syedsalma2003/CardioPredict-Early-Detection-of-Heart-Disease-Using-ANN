# CardioPredict-Early-Detection-of-Heart-Disease-Using-ANN
 This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict heart disease based on patient attributes such as age, cholesterol level, and blood pressure. The model uses a dataset with 13 features and aims to classify individuals as having heart disease or not, achieving about 85% accuracy.
